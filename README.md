DB -WIP-

::Quick_OUT_LOOK::

Us Here at DARK_iCE stride to bring you the best Core we can as this core was built from collecting/editting and writing
Code for varoius soucres and varoius repo's around git as well as the player's input and patches
one day we hope to have a core that is as close to blizz-like as possible
please remember that this is our own time we use to make and build this  we do not get paid for this
so please keep this in mind  as well as we are all still learning here

Welcome to C(ontinued)-MaNGOS
CMaNGOS is a free project with the following goal:

Doing WoW-Emulation Right!

This means, we want to focus on:

WoW-Emulation This project is about developing a server software that is able to emulate a well known MMORPG service.

Doing

This project is focused on developing content!
Also there are many other aspects that need to be done and are considered equally important.
Anyone who wants to do stuff is very welcome to do so!
Right

Our goal must always be to provide the best code that we can.
Being 'right' is defined by the behavior of the system we want to emulate.
Developing things right also includes documenting and discussing how to do things better, hence...
Learning and teaching are very important in our view, and must always be a part of what we do.
To be able to accomplish these goals, we support and promote:

Freedom

of our work: Our work - including our code - is released under the GPL. So everybody is free to use and contribute to this open source project.
for our developers and contributors on things that interest them. No one here is telling anybody what to do. If you want somebody to do something for you, pay them, but we are here to enjoy.
to have FUN with developing.
A friendly environment

We try to leave personal issues behind us.
We only argue about content, and not about thin air!
We follow the Netiquette.
-- The C(ontinued)-MaNGOS Team!
